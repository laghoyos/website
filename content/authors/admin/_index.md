## About Me

I am a Civil-Geological Engineer with 5+ years of experience in geospatial data, GIS and remote sensing. I hold a MSc degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Washington and a BSc degree in Geological Engineering from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. I excel in both autonomous and team-based learning environments; with outstanding interpersonal, written, and communication skills. I am adaptable to change and committed to continuous improvement. My creative and innovative mindset is focused on problem-solving, particularly within the realms of geospatial data analysis and management. In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I have a love for football, both as a player and a fan.
