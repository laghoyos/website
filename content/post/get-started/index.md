I recently had the incredible experience of watching a football game live for the first time outside Colombia, witnessing the intense Brazil vs. Colombia match during the Copa América 2024. This match, which ended in a 1-1 draw, was made even more special as I shared it with family and friends. The excitement of the game was heightened by the thrill of exploring new places. I had the chance to visit the iconic Golden Gate Bridge and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of Pier 39, adding unforgettable moments to this memorable trip outside my home country, Colombia.

Despite the draw, Colombia won Group D and extended their unbeaten streak to 26 matches, continuing under the leadership of our head coach, Néstor Lorenzo, who remains unbeaten since taking over in June 2022 [[❞]](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/copa-america-2024-daily-recap-colombia-bests-brazil-group-d-despite-draw). Colombia's journey in the tournament has been impressive, showcasing a strong defensive record and consistent performance. They advanced to the quarterfinals, where they secured a convincing 5-0 victory over Panama, further highlighting their dominance [[❞]](https://www.foxsports.com/watch/fmc-fombnjxqglf99h7n).
