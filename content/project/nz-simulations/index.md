This page describes a preliminary approach for landslide risk assessment which proposes an initial workflow. An example using the Jibson (1993) model to predict Newmark sliding block displacements is presented for a portion of Seattle, WA. Resources from the SimCenter M9 project are used to estimate ground-motion intensity parameters.
